# TripNGo
An app for organizing trips, picnic, and outings .etc
 This is an Amazon Teckathon submission project!
## Trips/gathering organizer
The application will allow users to organize the trips.
 Users can add Facebook posts or other links as the postings for the trip(i.e.: "a farmer for a rent in Amman").
The app helps split the bill between the group equally (default ) or with percentages.
Users can indicate they are buying or doing one of the tasks ( i.e.:ahmed will buy kebabs , john doe will book hotel rooms .etc)
Users can show that they are buying extra stuff that isn't in the original task ( these are added when users do them only)
Helps split cars and organize carpooling
The app will use AI to recommend future trips based on the users in that trip group and other people who went to similar places.
This app helps cut down on a lot of time for organizing a trip removing the inconvenience people face in the organization of a trip/gathering.
